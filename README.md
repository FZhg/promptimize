## Setup
```bash
pip -e .
```

## Getting started

First you'll need an openai API key, let's set it as an env var
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-{REDACTED}
```

```bash
# NOTE: CLI is `promptimize`, but `p9e` is a shorter synonym, can be used interchangibly

# First let's 
p9e ./examples
p9e ./examples

```

Now take a look at the definitions of what you just ran here ->
